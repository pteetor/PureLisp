# ConsVM project

This is an interpreter for the subset of Lisp defined by the Lisp 1.5 Programmer's Manual.

## Programming conventions

This project is written entirely in C++ (unlike my other projects which are mostly written in R).

## Unit tests

Unit tests are implemented using the `doctest` framework for C++.
